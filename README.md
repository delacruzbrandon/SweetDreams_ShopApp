# SweetDreams_ShopApp
The purpose of this App is to make employees in retail stores much more efficient in managing the inventory and cusotomers by using a single system built in the app.

Phase 1 of the app.
* The app will be installed on a tablet (1200 x 1920) that is owned by the retail store. 
* This tablet will be handed to customers for them to order in the app.
* Customers will have a different view from the employees when using the app.
* Cutomers will be able to order through the app.
* Everytime a customer finalizes their order, the employee will then be notified in their phone or tablet that the customer is finished 'shopping' in the app.
* Employees will also be able to add or remove items through the app depending on the stores inventory.
* Per item contains the products (4)images, price, short description, brand, weight, size, 
barcode, available stock, what type, color
	- Some info that the employees should only know like cost per item, date received, registered by

P.S.
* The design will not be like this when launched. Im changing a lot for it to look more material
* Still researching a lot of stuff, since im still new to Android Dev.
* Also planning to make the design look good on smart phones like Galaxy S10 
* This is still Phase 1, so there a lot I didnt add.
* Comments, critiques, advise are a big help to me.
